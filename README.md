## Description

This project required me to input semantic HTML elements, restructure the CSS, add alt attributes by providing a short image description and put them in sequential order, finally. put in a descriptive title of the webpage so viewers knew what page they were looking at. I built this project for a marketing agency so they could have a codebase that followed accessibility standards and their webpage is now optimized for search engines.
